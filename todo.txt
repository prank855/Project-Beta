SyncVars? https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/guides/synchronization/syncvars

private systems ???? idk what i meant here
mouse input
++batch network packets instead of sending one by one
INetworkSerializable interface !!
asset manager scene (forces initial scene to load assets then loads into main)
web workers for rendering?? threaded
jsdoc /** */ on all engine types
performance metrics (cpu/gpu/per system)
